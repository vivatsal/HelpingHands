                         <p>BEIRUT, 1 July 2021 – Children in Lebanon are bearing the brunt of one of the world’s worst economic collapses in recent times[1], according to a survey released by UNICEF today.
                         A series of mutually reinforcing crises, including a devastating recession, have left families and children in Lebanon in a dire situation, affecting just about every aspect of their lives, with few resources and virtually no access to social support.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>“With no improvement in sight, more children than ever before are going to bed hungry in Lebanon. Children’s health, education and their very futures are affected as prices are skyrocketing and unemployment continues to increase. More and more families are being forced to resort to negative coping measures, including sending their children to work in often dangerous and hazardous conditions, marrying off their young daughters or selling their belongings”, said Yukie Mokuo, UNICEF Representative in Lebanon.
                         <br/> 
                         <br/> 
                         According to a recent assessment conducted by UNICEF:
                         <br/>
                         Over 30 per cent of children went to bed hungry and skipped meals in the past month.
                         Seventy-seven per cent of households do not have enough food or enough money to buy food. In Syrian refugee households, the figure reaches 99 per cent.
                         Sixty per cent of households have to buy food on credit or borrow money.
                         Thirty per cent of children are not receiving the primary health care they need, while 76 per cent of households said they are affected by the massive increase in medication prices.
                         One in ten children has been sent to work.
                         Forty per cent of children are from families where no one has work and 77 per cent are from families that do not receive any social assistance.
                         Fifteen per cent of families stopped their children’s education.
                         Eighty per cent of caregivers said their children had difficulties concentrating on their studies at home – which might indicate hunger or mental distress.
                         The protracted economic depression is just one of the compounding crises in Lebanon, which is reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the aftermath of the massive August 2020 Beirut Port explosions, as well as the persistent political instability. While the 1.5 million Syrian refugees are the most hard-hit, the number of Lebanese people in need of support is growing rapidly.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>“The World Bank has described what is happening in Lebanon as possibly one of the top three economic collapses seen since the mid 19th Century. What the UNICEF survey shows is that children are bearing the brunt of this escalating catastrophe,” Yukie Mokuo remarked.
                         <br/>
                         UNICEF reinforces its call to the national authorities to implement a major expansion of social protection measures, to ensure access to quality education for every child, and to strengthen both primary healthcare and child protection services.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>“Determined, concerted action is critical to mitigate the suffering, particularly among the most vulnerable, who are trapped in a spiral of poverty”, said Yukie Mokuo. UNICEF is expanding its programme and, with the support of the donor community, the agency will be ready to help more children and families. “Children’s well-being and safeguard must be a top priority to ensure their rights are met under any circumstance. Lebanon cannot afford children to be nutritionally deprived, out of school, in poor health and at risk of abuse, violence and exploitation. Children are an investment, the ultimate investment, in a nation’s future.”

                         Notes to editors:
                         <br/>
                         UNICEF Child-Focused Rapid Assessment was conducted by telephone among 1,244 households in April 2021.
                         <br/>
                         Despite major challenges, UNICEF is mobilized to respond to the economic crisis, the impact of COVID-19 and the aftermath of the Beirut explosions. While working on expanding its  programme, UNICEF:
                         <br/>
                         <br/>Has launched an integrated child grant to support up to 70,000 children.<br/>
                         Is working with the ILO and national authorities on a national social grants programme.<br/>
                         Scaled up efforts to address malnutrition and provide mental health support to vulnerable children, particularly children engaged in child labour and other negative coping mechanisms.
                         <br/>
                         <br/>Spent $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 to secure water services for up to 4 million people.
                         Is supporting the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine.<br/>
                         Has supported isolation centres, provided personal protective equipment (PPE) and infection prevention and control (IPC) kits since April 2020.
                         <br/>Is supporting the rehabilitation of a hospital’s children and maternity wards and schools damaged by the Beirut port explosions.
                         <br/>Provided psychosocial first aid to children and caretakers affected by the explosions, distributed critical humanitarian supplies, saved vaccines from the damaged central warehouse, and engaged youth in a community-based response that involved cash-for-work.</p>,

                         What’s happening in Yemen?<br/>
                         Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with around 21 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 11 million children.
                         <br/>
                         Since the conflict escalated in March 2015, the country has become a living hell for the country’s children. Only half of health facilities are functioning, and many that remain operational lack basic equipment. Many health workers have not received a regular salary in several years.
                         <br/>
                         <br/> How is the crisis affecting children?<br/>
                         At least 10,000 children have been killed or maimed since the beginning of the conflict, and thousands more have been recruited into the fighting.  An estimated 1.7 million children are internally displaced. The damage and closure of schools and hospitals has also disrupted access to education and health services. More than two million children are out of school, leaving them even more vulnerable. 
                         <br/>
                         <br/>Meanwhile, Yemen has been plagued by one of the world’s worst food crises, with nearly 2.3 million children under the age of five projected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021. Of these, 400,000 are expected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition and could die if they do not receive urgent treatment. In addition, around 8.5 million children do not have access to safe water, sanitation, or hygiene.
                         <br/>
                         A dangerous combination of factors, driven by conflict and economic decline and now exacerbated by COVID-19, have compounded the dire situation for Yemen’s youngest children.
                         <br/>

                        <p>Crisis in Syria: What you need to know  <br/>
                        What is happening in the Syrian Arab Republic?  <br/>
                        Ten years of humanitarian crisis and hostilities has had a profound impact on the situation of children in Syria, across the region and beyond. Every Syrian child has been impacted by the violence, displacement, severed family ties and lack of access to vital services caused by massive physical devastation. 
                          <br/>
                        The situation in northern Syria is particularly alarming. In the northwest, millions of children remain displaced, with many families having fled violence multiple times, some as many as seven times, in search of safety.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>Families are also paying the price for an economic crisis and dangerous rise in food insecurity, with many struggling to afford to put food on the table, while an estimated half a million children are chronically malnourished. The COVID-19 pandemic has only deepened this crisis. 
                          <br/>
                        How have children been affected?  <br/>
                        The Syrian crisis remains first and foremost a protection crisis. Grave violations of children’s rights – recruitment, abductions, killing and maiming continue unabated. 
                          <br/>
                          <br/>Hyperinflation is having a devastating impact on families, with negative coping mechanisms on the rise. Parents are eating less so they can feed their children, sending them to work instead of to school, and girls and boys face the risk of early or forced marriage.
                          <br/>
                        The education system, meanwhile, is overstretched, underfunded, and fragmented. By early 2021, one in three schools inside Syria could no longer be used because they were destroyed, damaged or are being used for military purposes. Nearly 2.45 million children in Syria are out of school, while those children who are able to attend classes often learn in overcrowded classrooms, and in buildings with insufficient water and sanitation facilities, electricity, heating or ventilation.
                          <br/>
                        <br/> What is UNICEF doing to help children in the Syrian crisis?  <br/>
                        Millions of Syrian children require some form of humanitarian assistance. UNICEF and partners are on the ground in Syria and across the region working to protect children, to help them cope with the impact of conflict and to resume their childhoods. This includes improving access to education and psychosocial support services to help children and caregivers to recover from trauma and to restore a sense of normalcy, as well as delivering critical humanitarian assistance in hard-to-reach areas.
                          <br/>
                          <br/>Working with partners, UNICEF continues to deliver assistance including hygiene kits, safe drinking water, and screening and treatment of malnutrition. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, UNICEF and partners have been sharing prevention and risk awareness messages and materials. Read more about UNICEF’s work and results in the country.,

                        <p>What is the Rohingya crisis? <br/>
                        When hundreds of thousands of terrified Rohingya refugees began flooding onto the beaches and paddy fields of southern Bangladesh in August 2017, it was the children who caught many people’s attention. As the refugees – almost 60 per cent of whom were children – poured across the border from Myanmar into Bangladesh, they brought with them accounts of the unspeakable violence and brutality that had forced them to flee.
                        <br/>
                        By mid-2021, Bangladesh was hosting more than 880,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in 34 camps in the Cox’s Bazar District, around half of whom were children. Those fleeing attacks and violence in the 2017 exodus joined around 300,000 people already in Bangladesh from previous waves of displacement, effectively forming the world’s largest refugee camp.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a new threat to these overcrowded conditions. Many refugees live in flimsy bamboo and tarpaulin shelters where the dangers of everyday life remain all too real. On 22 March 2021, a fire in Cox’s Bazar caused widespread devastation when it quickly spread across four Rohingya refugee camps, displacing around 50,000 refugees – half of whom were children.
                        <br/>
                        
                        <br/> How is the Rohingya crisis affecting children?<br/>
                        While basic services have been provided, children still face disease outbreaks, malnutrition, inadequate educational opportunities and the risks related to neglect, exploitation and violence including gender-based violence risks, child marriage and child labour. Meanwhile, annual cycles of heavy monsoon and cyclones pose substantial risks to both Rohingya refugees and host communities.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>In Myanmar, most Rohingya have no legal identity or citizenship and statelessness remains a significant concern. Rohingya children in Rakhine State, meanwhile, have been hemmed in by violence, forced displacement and restrictions on freedom of movement. 
                        <br/>
                        Until the conditions are in place in Myanmar that would allow Rohingya families to return home with basic rights – safety from violence, citizenship, free movement, health and education – they are stuck as refugees or internally displaced persons living in overcrowded and sometimes dangerous conditions.
                        <br/>
                        Older children and adolescents who are deprived of opportunities to learn or make a living are at real risk of becoming a “lost generation”
                        <br/>
                        Older children and adolescents who are deprived of opportunities to learn or make a living are at real risk of becoming a “lost generation”, ready prey to traffickers and those who would exploit them for political or other ends. Girls and women are at particular risk of sexual and other gender-based violence in this situation, including being forced into early marriage and being left out of school as parents keep them at home.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>What is UNICEF doing to help children in the Rohingya crisis? <br/>
                        UNICEF is on the ground, working with the government and partners, helping to deliver life-saving supplies and services for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. 
                        To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, for example, UNICEF and partners have been providing safe water and soap supplies, and have installed communal handwashing stations in the camps. UNICEF is also making sure that children have access to life-saving information on protecting themselves and their communities against the coronavirus.

                        <p>Crisis overview: What’s happening in Central African Republic?<br/>
                        In December 2013, Bangui, the capital of Central African Republic, descended into a brutal bloodbath as the already fragile state was further weakened. Early signs of recovery and rebuilding soon gave way to a dramatic resurgence in fighting, with armed groups frequently targeting civilians rather than each other.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Despite a February 2019 peace agreement signed between the Government and 14 armed groups, the security situation in the country remains precarious. In the run-up to and after the general elections of December 2020, armed conflict between Government forces and a coalition of armed groups in several towns forced an estimated 168,000 children and their families to flee their homes. By April 2021, around 370,000 children across the country were internally displaced because of ongoing violence and insecurity.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>The combined effects of violence, COVID-19, fragility following long-standing socio-political, structural and governance deficiencies, and deep-seated feelings of marginalization between communities, have left an estimated 2.8 million people needing humanitarian assistance. Yet despite the urgent needs of families, international attention has been scant and the humanitarian response chronically underfunded. Urgent assistance is more important than ever – without it, an entire generation is at risk.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>How are children being affected?<br/>
                        The Central African Republic is one of the toughest places in the world to be a child. The economic slowdown and rising food prices have had a significant impact on the well-being of families. By early July 2021, at least 80,000 children under the age of five were at risk of severe acute malnutrition, with 40 per cent of children under five already suffering from chronic malnutrition, according to UNICEF and the World Food Programme.
                        <br/>
                        Even before the COVID-19, children in the Central African Republic were badly affected by other epidemics, including measles and polio. But since the pandemic began, there has been a significant fall in immunization rates due to the challenges faced in conducting routine immunization. 
                        <br/>
                        More than anything, though, the children of Central African Republic desperately need security. The places they go for protection and support – including schools, hospitals and places of worship – are under attack by the armed groups. Hundreds of schools are non-operational as a result of fighting, leaving half the country’s children out of school – and even more vulnerable to exploitation and violence.
                        <br />
                        <br/>What is UNICEF doing to help children in Central African Republic? <br/>
                        Despite challenging security and access conditions, UNICEF and partners have continued to respond wherever possible. UNICEF is on the ground supporting efforts to release children from armed groups; reunifying separated or unaccompanied children with their families; providing appropriate psychosocial support to children affected by conflict; helping mobilize communities for prevention of COVID-19; addressing preventable childhood illnesses, malaria, HIV and malnutrition; developing sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure in underserved areas; and helping children access safe learning spaces and quality education.

                        <p>Increased conflict and insecurity in Afghanistan have left children paying a heavy price. Afghanistan was already one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a child. Now, with a security crisis, skyrocketing food prices, a severe drought and the spread of COVID-19, children are at greater risk than ever.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>UNICEF has been on the ground in Afghanistan for 65 years with offices nationwide and a range of partners that support us in delivering life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable, especially children. UNICEF is supporting mobile health and nutrition teams in camps for internally displaced persons, setting up nutrition hubs and vaccination sites, pre-positioning additional life-saving supplies, and supporting students in community-based education classes.
                        <br/>
                        Children should not pay for conflict with their childhoods. Afghanistan’s children need peace.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>With support from our extended UNICEF family, the flexible funding they provide, UNICEFAfg is on the ground saving lives of children mothers in Afghanistan.

                        <p>Juba, 20 August 2021 – Young people living in South Sudan are among those most at risk of the impacts of climate change, threatening their health, education, and protection, according to a UNICEF report launched today.
                        <br/>
                        ‘The Climate Crisis Is a Child Rights Crisis: Introducing the Children’s Climate Risk Index’ is the first comprehensive analysis of climate risk from a child’s perspective. It ranks countries based on children’s exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services.
                        <br/>
                        Launched in collaboration with Fridays for Future on the third anniversary of the youth-led global climate strike movement, the report finds approximately 1 billion children – nearly half the world's 2.2 billion children – live in one of the 33 countries classified as “extremely high-risk”. Figures are likely to get worse as the impacts of climate change accelerate.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>South Sudan is among these countries, with a ranking of seven. The report found South Sudan’s children are highly exposed to heatwaves and vector-borne diseases, but also that investments in social services, particularly in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and child health and nutrition can make a significant difference in our ability to safeguard their futures from the impacts of climate change.
                        <br/>
                        “The climate crisis is a child’s rights crisis and in South Sudan, where two out of three children are unable to access even their most basic rights, outcomes could be catastrophic,” said Hamida Lasseko, UNICEF Country Representative. "South Sudan is becoming a more dangerous place for children to live, but if we act now we can prevent it from becoming worse. If we invest to make the services they depend upon to survive and thrive – such as water, healthcare and education – resilient, it will help to protect their futures from the impacts of a changing climate and degrading environment.”
                        <br/>
                        <br/>The Children’s Climate Risk Index (CCRI) reveals:
                        <br/>
                        240 million children are highly exposed to coastal flooding;<br/>
                        330 million children are highly exposed to riverine flooding;<br/>
                        400 million children are highly exposed to cyclones;<br/>
                        600 million children are highly exposed to vector-borne diseases;<br/>
                        815 million children are highly exposed to lead pollution;<br/>
                        820 million children are highly exposed to heatwaves;<br/>
                        920 million children are highly exposed to water scarcity;<br/>
                        1 billion children are highly exposed to exceedingly high levels of air pollution<br/>
                        An estimated 850 million children – 1 in 3 worldwide – live in areas where at least four of these climate and environmental shocks overlap. As many as 330 million children – 1 in 7 worldwide – live in areas affected by at least five major shocks.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>The report also reveals a disconnect between where greenhouse gas emissions are generated, and where children are enduring the most significant climate-driven impacts. The 33 extremely high-risk countries collectively emit just 9 per cent of global CO2 emissions. Conversely, the 10 highest emitting countries collectively account for nearly 70 per cent of global emissions. Only one of these countries is ranked as ‘extremely high-risk’ in the index.
                        <br/>
                        “In South Sudan, we suffer a lot from climate change, and we are facing this in our daily lives. A lot of areas get flooded with water and a lot of children die in the flood. And because of cutting down trees, the floods are increasing. Droughts are also making it hard to get food. It destroys plants and crops,” said Wendy Ahonda, a UNICEF South Sudan Child Reporter.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>“The children of South Sudan know climate change is a threat to their future, and they are calling on the world leaders to act. So far, too little has been done, but we still have time. We must urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work as a global community to build a better world for all children,” said Lasseko.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Without the urgent action required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, children will continue to suffer the most. Compared to adults, children require more food and water per unit of their body weight, are less able to survive extreme weather events, and are more susceptible to toxic chemicals, temperature changes and diseases, among other factors.

                        <p>GENEVA, 20 April 2021 - This is a summary of what was said by UNICEF spokesperson James Elder – to whom quoted text may be attributed –  at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.
                        <br/>
                        The crisis in Tigray has entered its sixth month with no clear end in sight.
                        <br/>
                        More than one million people have been displaced, and fighting continues. Access and security remain serious issues.
                        <br/>
                        We have been very concerned from the onset about the harm this crisis will cause to children. Such fears are now being realized.
                        <br/>
                        This is a protection crisis. What is emerging is a disturbing picture of severe and ongoing child rights violations.
                        <br/>
                        This is also an education and nutrition emergency, and I saw extensive destruction to the systems and essential services on which children rely.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Education<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Children in Tigray have been hit by COVID-19 then conflict. That means 1.4 million children have been out of school for more than a full year (since March 2020). Yes, not a day of school in 13 months.
                        
                        I met a 16-year-old girl, Merhawit who fled fighting in the west of Tigray, and walked – with her baby brother on her back – for 300km. Yes, she walked 300km in broken flip flops. Before the conflict, she was top of her class in physics. Now she was searching for food and hasn’t seen a classroom in more than a year.
                        
                        A decision to reopen schools, however, is contingent on (1) security; (2) rehabilitation works - the Ministry of Education estimates that up to 25 per cent of schools have been damaged; and (3) reopening schools requires the relocation of the hundreds of thousands of IDPs who are currently sheltering in school premises. 
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Water<br/>
                        <br/>
                        A recent assessment in 13 towns by UNICEF and partners revealed that more than half of the boreholes are non-functional.  These were advanced systems – with generators and electrical circuitry – and most have been damaged and looted.
                        
                        I saw an example of this destruction in a health clinic 100km from Mekelle. This had an entire new operation ward devoted to emergency c-sections for mothers and emergency surgery - that opened in 2020, with the support of Rotary in Belgium. Everything - X-ray machines, oxygen, and mattresses for patients – are gone. Operating beds and incubators for babies have been broken and turned upside down. A doctor there told me “It had all the services a mother and baby needed. It was a life-saving place. There was no reason for forces to come here. They came here for vandalizing and looting.”
                        
                        According to assessments, violence and looting have left a majority of health care facilities in the region not functioning.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>The sanitation situation is another matter of grave concern. Conditions in many of the displacement sites are poor. They are overcrowded, unsanitary and unsafe .. as such they magnify risks of exploitation of children, and make it impossible for people to practice COVID-19 prevention measures.
                        
                        From a health perspective, the presence of large numbers of displaced people is a ticking time bomb, especially as the rainy season approaches – that’s next month - when there will be a grave risk of cholera and other water-borne diseases.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Protection and gender-based violence<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The personal statements I received from children who had been raped or testimonies of women who were victims of sexual violence were harrowing.
                        <br/>
                        You will all be aware that the President of Ethiopia, the Minister of Women, Children and Youth, the IASC Principals and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) have spoken against multiple cases of rape and sexual violence
                        <br/>
                        I heard traumatic stories from survivors, one as young as 14. I heard reports of gang rapes. The level of cruelty described in these attacks was bewildering.
                        <br/>
                        This year, from the 1st January to 16 April, just one centre that UNICEF supports has received an average of three reports of cases of gender-based violence per day.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Nutrition<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Fighting broke out just as people should have been harvesting.
                        
                        That’s their income for a year. Many also had cattle stolen. They have lost access to fertilisers and vaccines for their livestock.
                        
                        And now they should be planting. But more than 1 million people are displaced and as such cannot access their land.
                        
                        As such, we are seeing a spike in malnutrition in a region that had already seen steep year-on-year increases in malnourished children requiring life-saving treatment prior to this crisis.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>In response, since November last year, UNICEF has provided emergency supplies including drug kits, nutrition supplies, school-in-a-carton kits and early childhood development kits. 
                        
                        In WASH, UNICEF is leading on efforts to rehabilitate damaged water schemes, supply of water through trucking, and the provision of hygiene supplies. Through these efforts, more than 640,000 people have received safe water for personal use.
                        
                        Our priority in the education sector is the reopening of schools while simultaneously working with implementing partners to establish temporary learning spaces for refugees, IDPs and host communities.
                        
                        We have supported partners to kick-start 22 mobile health and nutrition teams which are reaching tens of thousands of children and women in ten of the areas with the highest need. They distribute drug kits and support emergency health care and nutrition. They operate six days a week and use the seventh day to restock supplies.
                        
                        But again, even for these brave and frontline mobile health and nutrition teams, security remains an issue. I spoke with one team leader who explained how his team had their ambulance stolen, and had to walk three days back to their health clinic.
                        <br/>
                        And as of right before this briefing, UNICEF has received credible reports of at least 16 incidents that impacted the activities of these mobile health and nutrition teams … in just the last two weeks.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Nine were reported in the Eastern Region where the health workers had to leave the location due to fighting and direct threat from armed forces.
                        
                        The staff members were denied access to the programme locations and in some cases were threatened with death. In three locations the teams were forcibly relocated to other locations.
                        
                        Survivors of sexual assault have been provided with medical assistance, psychosocial support and dignity kits at a centre that has been supported by UNICEF. We are also supporting partners to deploy more than 160 social workers to provide child protection case management for vulnerable children including unaccompanied and separated children; and psychosocial support in IDP and refugee camps in Tigray and affected neighbouring woredas in Afar and Amhara.
                        <br/> 
                        <br/>UNICEF Ethiopia’s appeal for Tigray stands at US$47.6 million. More than half is unfunded.
